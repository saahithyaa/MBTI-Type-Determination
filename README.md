# MBTI Type Determination from Twitter History

## About the Project

This project revolves around analyzing a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type/data) sourced from the PersonalityCafe forum, containing over 8600 rows of data. Each row includes:

- **[‘type’]**: A person's MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator) personality type, represented by a 4-letter code.
- **[‘posts’]**: A section of the last 50 things they have posted, with each entry separated by "|||".

## Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)

The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axes:

1. **Extraversion (E) or Introversion (I)**
   - Opposite ways to direct and receive energy.
   - Do you prefer to focus on the outer world or your own inner world?

2. **Sensing (S) or Intuition (N)**
   - Opposite ways to take in information.
   - Do you prefer to focus on the facts or the big picture?

3. **Thinking (T) or Feeling (F)**
   - Opposite ways to decide and come to conclusions.
   - Do you prefer to take an objective or an empathetic approach for deciding?

4. **Judging (J) or Perceiving (P)**
   - Opposite ways to approach the outside world.
   - Do you prefer to seek closure or stay open to new information?

When you combine your preferences (E or I, S or N, T or F, J or P), they make up your MBTI type (four-letter type code)—your psychological or personality type. There are 16 possible combinations of letters leading to 16 distinct MBTI personality types.

The theory of psychological type says that people with different preferences naturally have different interests and views, behave differently, and are motivated by different things. Awareness of differences between types can help people understand and value other people who think and act quite differently.

For example, someone who prefers introversion, intuition, thinking, and perceiving would be labeled an INTP in the MBTI system, and there are lots of personality-based components that would model or describe this person’s preferences or behavior based on the label.

## Project Goals

This dataset aims to explore patterns in writing style associated with specific MBTI types, thus contributing to the ongoing discussion regarding the validity and usefulness of the MBTI in analyzing, predicting, or categorizing behavior. 

Potential applications of this dataset include:

- Utilizing machine learning algorithms to evaluate the MBTI's validity in predicting language styles and behavior online.
- Developing algorithms capable of determining a person's personality type based on their written text.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project seeks to shed light on the relationship between language use and personality types, offering insights into the potential strengths and limitations of the MBTI as a tool for understanding human behavior.
